openXBOW - the Passau Open-Source Crossmodal Bag-of-Words Toolkit  

openXBOW generates a bag-of-words representation from a sequence of numeric and/or textual features, e.g., acoustic LLDs, visual features and transcriptions of natural speech. 
The tool provides a multitude of options, e.g., different modes of vector quantisation, codebook generation, term frequency weighting and methods known from natural language processing. 
openXBOW has been implemented in Java.  
Please call "java -jar openXBOW.jar" for information on the input format and a list of all available options.
